<h2>H.B.C. Pioneer Steamer Ruled
West Coast Trade 20 Years</h2>

<div class='center'>
<i>The “Beaver,” of 109 Tons Burthen, Took Prominent<br />
Part in History of British Columbia–Cared<br />
for Wants of 40,000 Natives.</i><br />
<br />
By C. H. FRENCH<br />
</div>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was not a single phase of
British Columbia history from
1835 to 1874 in which H.B.S.S. “Beaver”
did not play a large part. She was
admired by all those old pioneers associated
with the history of the West Coast.</p>

<p>The foundation of Victoria City was
laid by the “Beaver.” Fort Rupert
and Nanaimo were built under her
protection, and though Fort Simpson
was founded prior to her arrival on the
coast, she was the main protection of
that establishment for many years
afterwards.</p>


<h3><i>Ship Used to Keep Law and Order</i></h3>

<p>Operations of the Hudson’s Bay
Company in Russian America were
entirely under her control and many
minor difficulties in that region were
effectively settled promptly on her
arrival at the seat of trouble. When,
too, the reign of law and order was
threatened closer home, in every case
the arrival of the “Beaver” was awaited
before effective steps could be taken to
bring affairs back to a normal state.</p>

<p>On one occasion, two murderers
escaped to Cowichan and the warship
“Thetis” sent a hundred and fifty of
her men on the “Beaver” and proceeded
to Cowichan under command of James
Douglas to administer the law.</p>

<p>There were many other cases of this
nature that demonstrated the “Beaver’s”
usefulness in developing and
colonizing British Columbia, particularly
the north coast.</p>


<h3><i>The “Beaver” Steamed Round
the Horn</i></h3>

<p>It was, to many, a marvel that a small
boat of this kind could steam round
Cape Horn and weather any storm that
she encountered. These men forget
that, though small, she was built of
stoutest oak and was considered a
more able and seaworthy craft than
many of much larger size operating today.</p>

<p>Her keel was of unusual size and in
full keeping with the British oak stem
and stern post. The best greenheart
and oak ribs were used, being carefully
dressed and of large size. The spaces
between these frames were filled in
solidly to a level above the water line
with curved timbers of the same
material as the ribs. Outside planking
was oak and African teak, fastened with
copper bolts and tree nails, covered
with a layer of thick tar paper and then
sheeted with fir fastened with spikes of
bronze composition. The hull was
surfaced with a sheeting of copper.</p>


<h3><i>Launched Under Royal Patronage</i></h3>

<p>Her length was a hundred and one
feet, breadth inside paddle boxes twenty
feet, outside thirty-three feet, depth
eleven and one-half feet, having one
hundred and nine tons burden. She
carried a crew of twenty-six men and
was armed with five nine-pounders.
Her building, and especially her launching,
created a great interest, as she is
reported to have plunged into the
mighty Thames under the patronage of
royalty and in the presence of a vast
throng of spectators.</p>


<h3><i>H.B.C. Quality Shewn in Building</i></h3>

<p>The construction of the “Beaver”
indicates that the Hudson’s Bay Company
were up-to-date and were living
up to their British traditions by being
always first in the field in any new
enterprise that required capital and
far-sighted commercial methods. It
must be remembered that steam vessels
were not at that time proven to be
successful, but were in the experimental
stage. The spirit of adventure, as the
term was understood in those days,
was much in evidence when the Company’s
Governor and Committee ordered
the “Beaver” in 1834 from
Messrs. Green, Wigham &amp; Green, at
Blackwall, London.</p>

<div class="caption"><i>The “Beaver” Riding at Anchor Near Victoria</i></div>
</div>

<p>Two new masts were made and installed
at Port Simpson in 1858 by a
carpenter named Rudlin, and she was
sent to Sitka, Alaska, to be overhauled
by the Russians the same winter (1858).
Apart from this, nothing seems to have
been spent on her other than what her
own crew could do.</p>

<p>She had two engines 35 nominal
horsepower, each of the long since
obsolete side-lever type, though much
in favour during those early times
following the “Beaver’s” construction.</p>

<p>It was an interesting day when the
keel of this wonderful little black
steamer was laid, but how much more
interesting must the 29th day of
August, 1835, have been when the
“Beaver” glided down into the English
Channel and out on the trackless ocean
on her voyage to the north Pacific
ocean to become famous in the annals
of the west.</p>

<p>The “Beaver” arrived at Robinson
Crusoe Island, via Cape Horn, December
17th, 1835, and Astoria (Columbia
River) April 4th, 1836.</p>


<h3><i>H.B.C. Fur Headquarters on
Columbia River</i></h3>

<p>The Hudson’s Bay Company’s fur
trade up to this date had as its headquarters
on the Pacific Coast the
Columbia River, but as the trade was
being developed it was soon apparent
that Columbia River was not the most
suitable location from which to administer
affairs. The ships from
London were taking great risks when
crossing the Columbia River bar, and
as there were no steam tugs available,
going up the Columbia River with a
sailing vessel for one hundred miles or
more was not at all to their liking.
The coastwise boats, apart from the
“Beaver,” were all small sailing-ships
and the voyage to the Columbia from
Puget Sound was really a stupendous
undertaking.</p>

<p>The Hudson’s Bay Company’s possessory
rights in Oregon were the
stumbling blocks. If the Columbia
River establishments were abandoned
the Company’s claim might be jeopardized,
and rather than do that a
route was opened through from Fort
Vancouver to Nisqually on the Puget
Sound via the Cowlitz River, where
trade goods could be transported by
boat and ox-cart and shipped north on
the ships engaged in the trade, thereby
saving much time to the ships but
wasting considerable of the time of the
land forces.</p>


<h3><i>The “Beaver’s” Coast Route</i></h3>

<p>From Nisqually, the “Beaver” took
a full cargo in January, proceeding to
Fort Simpson, calling en route at all
Indian villages where she would anchor,
throw out her boarding nets and proceed
to trade, so that by the time she reached
Fort Simpson a large part of her cargo
would have been traded.</p>

<p>At Fort Simpson the furs collected
were taken ashore and stored and the
ship restocked with trade goods; then
she proceeded, calling at all villages en
route to Taku. Returning to Fort
Simpson, furs were unloaded and more
goods taken.</p>

<p>This procedure was kept up all
summer, the “Beaver” making about
four trips north, and the same number
south, leaving off in time to reach
Victoria before Christmas.</p>

<p>The “Beaver” was not subject to
orders from any but Sir James Douglas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
but she had all Posts on the route she
covered under her control. It was
estimated that she <i>had to cater to the
wants of forty thousand natives</i>.</p>


<h3><i>Monarch of Trade for Twenty
Years</i></h3>

<p>For twenty years she was complete
monarch of the coast. In all new
Indian trade countries and indeed in
all new white settlements, the wants of
the population had gradually increased,
until in 1852 the “Beaver” was found
to be totally inadequate for the trade.
A new boat was built for the Company
in England and named the “Otter,”
arriving at Victoria in April, 1853.</p>


<h3><i>Victoria to San Francisco
in Four Days</i></h3>

<p>One of the “Otter’s” first duties after
arriving at Victoria from England was
to go to San Francisco. Sir James
Douglas says, “In spite of head winds,
she went down in four days and returned
in five days, and she was much admired
where her unexpected arrival created
quite a sensation.”</p>

<p>She was the first steamer propelled by
a screw to be brought out by the
Company, and was altogether just as
successful as was the “Beaver” and
had the same fault–being too small.
However, the “Beaver” and “Otter”
between them were able to take care of
the work for a few years, until the
“Enterprise” was purchased in 1862, to
help out on the Fraser River run during
the great Caribou gold excitement.</p>


<h3><i>“Beaver” Chartered to British
Government</i></h3>

<p>It is easy to understand that by this
time the “Beaver’s” engines were in
need of attention, and it was under
discussion as to whether they should be
taken out and sent home to be re-bored,
or whether the steamer should be sent
herself to have repairs effected; but
before a decision was reached, the boat
was chartered to the British Government
for the purpose of survey work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Hudson’s Bay Company
had built in England another
ship, the “Labouchere.” She was of
the paddle-wheel type, but much larger
and more costly to operate than the
“Beaver.” The zeal of the Hudson’s
Bay Company’s officers to get an up-to-date
boat caused them to overlook
the fact that money and business were
not plentiful, and a steamer to operate
successfully on the coast must be carefully
selected. When they realized
their mistake, other work was sought,
with the result that she was placed on
the San Francisco-Victoria mail route
in competition with the California
Steam Navigation Company’s steamer
“Active,” and a rate war, probably the
first on the coast, was started. It
ended suddenly, however, when the
“Labouchere” on her second trip was
wrecked at Point Ray.</p>

<h2>LITTLE JOURNEYS TO<br />
FUR TRADE POSTS OF<br />
THE HUDSON’S BAY CO.<br /></h2></div>



<h3>GRAHAM POST</h3>

<p class='center'><i>Sioux Lookout, Ontario</i><br />

By L. J. WILLIAMS</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/i-004-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-004.jpg" width="300" height="180" alt="Store" /></a>
<div class="caption"><i>H.B.C. Store, Sioux Lookout, Ont.</i></div>
</div>


<p class='drop-cap'>GRAHAM is one of the comparatively
small number of H.B.C.
“line” posts, <i>i.e.</i>, fur trading establishments
located close to railway transportation.
Graham Post is on the
Canadian National Railway at Sioux
Lookout, a town of nearly one thousand
people and a railroad and lumbering
centre.</p>

<p>The name “Sioux Lookout” was
taken from the high rocky hill just
west of the town. Indian legends
relate that this high hill was often used
by wandering bands of Sioux warriors,
who, ranging far from their Dakota
prairies, watched with keen eyes from
the top of this hill the narrow gorge from
Pelican to Abraham’s Lake as they laid
plans to ambush and exterminate the
Indians of that district. A fire ranger’s
observation tower now stands at the
summit of the hill.</p>

<p>Sioux Lookout lies close by Pelican
Lake, one of the chain of lakes comprising
the original H.B.C. freight route
from the Canadian Pacific Railway to
inland posts to the northward–<i>Lac
Seul</i>, <i>Osnaburgh</i>, <i>Fort Hope</i> and
<i>Cat Lake</i>.</p>

<p>The staff of the Company’s present
day post at Graham includes the post-manager,
three clerks, a deliveryman,
bookkeeper and junior office clerk. The
Company’s business, in addition to fur
trading, is derived from the population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of Sioux Lookout and comprises the
transient trade to and from the lumber
camps located to the east and west
of the town.</p>

<p>The wonderful waterways and remarkable
scenic beauty of the country
surrounding Sioux Lookout rival those
of Minaki. Vacationers and camping
parties in ever increasing numbers are
going to Sioux Lookout every Summer,
where nearly everybody has a motor
boat or canoe to traverse the wondrous
stretches of waterways with their miles
and miles of beautiful bays and fine
sandy beaches.</p>

<h3>ESPRIT DE CORPS</h3>

<p class='center'><i>And Why it Builds Successful
Companies</i><br />

By H. F. HARMAN, <i>Land Commissioner</i></p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THE literal meaning of “Esprit de
Corps” denotes the common spirit
pervading the members of a body or
association of persons.</p>

<p>It implies sympathy, enthusiasm,
devotion, and jealous regard for the
honor of the organization as a whole.</p>

<p>This French phrase was the unwritten
but ever present motto or
slogan which finally brought about the
successful termination of the war for
the Allies.</p>

<p>Read slowly the interpretation of
the phrase and you will realize its
tremendous import when faithfully,
persistently exercised.</p>

<p>This is the spirit which, for the past
250 years, has animated so many loyal
officials and servants of the “Governor
and Company of Adventurers of England
Trading into Hudson Bay.”
Let this generation see to it that we
do not become indifferent to this very
essential and necessary characteristic.</p>

<p>This spirit should prevail throughout
the Company’s service in the Dominion
and elsewhere, and when difficulties
and differences of opinion arise, as
they always will in the natural course
of our everyday pursuits, let us all,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in
towns, cities and the farthest interior,
just remember to say to ourselves
“Esprit de Corps, under all circumstances,”
or, as the Governor put it
during his recent visit to Canada,
“pour a little oil on the machinery when
it does not run perfectly and smoothly.”
(It’s the only lubricant available these
days.)</p>

<p>Try to put yourself in the other
fellow’s shoes and do unto him as you
would he should do unto you.</p>

<p>If I were asked, “What institutions
do you consider have been, and are
yet, of the greatest service to Canada?”
my reply would be: “Hudson’s Bay
Company and Canadian Pacific Railway.”
“And what has been the chief
factor which has created such an
enviable position for these two companies?”–“Esprit
de Corps.”</p>

<p>The success of any organization or
corporation depends upon this; let
us constantly keep this motto before us.</p>

<h3>Lost in the Bush</h3>

<p class='center'>By ASHTON ALSTON</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>IT being a bright, cold, frosty morning
in the latter part of October, the
Indians all off to their hunting grounds
and nothing much doing around the
post, I thought that I would take a
day off and go and put down some
marten and fisher traps.</p>

<p>I got away about 7 a.m. and after
paddling about six miles I arrived at
the end of the lake and took to the bush.
Heading in a northerly direction I
trudged along, placing snares for fur
at various likely looking places, and so
interested was I in my work that I did
not notice that the day was fast slipping
by and night approaching.</p>

<p>It must have been late in the afternoon
when I startled a flock of partridges
which got away before I could get
a shot at them. After following the
direction in which they had gone for
some distance and failing to locate
them, I thought, therefore, that I
would hit the trail for home, but after
walking for some time I realized that
I was lost.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the wind was
getting up and low, angry clouds were
scudding across the sky, which foretold,
as a sailor would say, “a dirty night.”
Not expecting to be so long away,
I had not brought provisions with me,
so was beginning to feel hungry.</p>

<p>The sun had long since disappeared
and the night was coming on, so I
thought it best to look for a good
camping place. I luckily came across
a spot with any amount of dry and
green wood, so started to make things
comfortable for the night. I first of all
cut down some green trees and with
the branches made a shelter. Then I
cut enough dry wood to last the night,
made a good fire and lay down in front
of it. Fortunately, having a good supply
of tobacco and my pipe, I was able to
make myself comfortable.</p>

<p>About 8 o’clock, however, things
changed for the worse. The thermometer
dropped and it began to blow and
snow. It snowed more or less all night,
and having no blankets or overcoat
with me, I was employed the best part
of the night in keeping the fire burning.
The long night came to an end at last.
The wind dropped and the snow
ceased falling. Soon the sun appeared
above the tree tops, looking warm
and big. I was then enabled to get my
bearings. I took out my watch and
pointed the hour hand towards the sun.
Midway between the hour hand and
twelve o’clock I knew was south. It
does not matter what hour of the day
one does this, the result is the same.</p>

<p>By this means I was enabled to get
my bearings, and knowing that I
had been travelling in a more or less
northeasterly direction the day previous
I took a southwesterly course. After
travelling for six hours through thick
bush, climbing over dead falls and
crossing many creeks, I struck the lake
where I had left my canoe and found
it a little over a mile from where I
came out to the lake.</p>

<p>Ice was forming on the lake and the
country was white with a blanket of
snow. Having no mitts, my fingers
got numbed from time to time. I soon
launched the canoe and made for home.
At last the post came in sight, and I
can assure you that I received a great
welcome. It was not long before I had
a moose steak put before me. This,
washed down with several cups of
hot coffee, soon made me forget my
experience of the night.</p>

<h3>Explorations by Adventurers
of the H.B.C.</h3>

<p class='center'>(<i>Continued from December Number</i>)<br />

Arranged by J. PREST</p>

<p>Sometimes more dangerous game
than buffalo was encountered. On
September 17, Hendry writes, “Two
men were miserably wounded by a
grizzly bear that they were hunting
today. One may recover but the other
never can. His arm is torn from his
body, one eye gouged out and his
stomach ripped open.” The next day
the Indian died.</p>

<p>The Assiniboines were marching
southwest from the Pas towards the
land of the Blackfeet. They were now
three hundred miles southwest of the
French House. To Hendry’s surprise
they came to a large river with high
banks that looked exactly like the
Saskatchewan. It was the South
Branch of the Saskatchewan, where it
takes the great bend south of Prince
Albert. Canoes had been left far
behind. What were the four hundred
Assiniboines to do? But the Indians
solved the difficulty in less than half a
day. Making boats of willow branches
and moose parchment skin–like the
bull boats of the Missouri–the Assiniboines
rafted safely across. The
march now turned west toward the
Eagle River and Eagle Hills and North
Saskatchewan. The Eagle Indians
are met and persuaded to bring their
furs to York Fort.</p>

<p>As winter approached, the women
began dressing the skins for moccasins
and clothes. A fire of punk in an earth
hole smoked the skins. Beating and
pounding and stretching pelts, the
squaws then softened the skin. For
winter wear, moccasins were left with
the fur inside. Hendry remarks how in
the fall of the year the women sat in the
doors of their wigwams “knitting moose
leather into snow shoes” made of
seasoned wood. It was October before
the Indians of the far western plains
were met. These were the famous
Blackfeet, for the first time now seen by
an English trader. They approached
the Assiniboines mounted and armed
with bows and spears. Hendry gave
them presents to carry to their chief.
Hendry notes the signs of mines along
the banks of the Saskatchewan. He
thought the mineral iron. What he
saw was probably an outcropping of
coal. The jumping deer he describes
as a new kind of goat. As soon as
ice formed on the swamps, the hunters
began trenching for beaver, which were
plentiful beyond the fur traders’ hopes.
When, on October 11th, the marchers
for the third time came on the Saskatchewan,
which the Indians called
Waskesaw, Hendry recognized that all
the branches were forks of one and the
same great river, the Saskatchewan, or,
as the French called it, Christinaux.
The Indian names for the two branches
were Keskatchew and Waskesaw.</p>

<p>For several days the far smoke of an
encampment had been visible, southwest.
On October the 14th, four riders
came out to conduct Hendry to an
encampment of three hundred and
twenty-two tents of Blackfeet Indians,
“pitched in two rows with an opening
in the middle, where we were conducted
to the leader’s tent.” This was the
main tribe of which Hendry had already
met the outrunners. “The leader’s
tent was large enough to contain fifty
persons. He received us seated on a
buffalo skin, attended by twenty elderly
men. He made signs for me to sit down
on his right hand, which I did. Our
leaders (the Assiniboines) set several
great pipes going the rounds and we
smoked according to their custom.</p>

<p>Not one word was spoken. Smoking
over, boiled buffalo flesh was served in
baskets of bent wood. I was presented
with ten buffalo tongues. My guide
informed the leader I was sent by the
grand leader who lives on the Great
Waters to invite his young men down
with their furs. They would receive
in return, powder, shot, guns and cloth.
He made little answer; said it was far
off and his people could not paddle.
We were then ordered to depart to our
tents which we pitched a quarter of a
mile outside their lines. Again invited
to the leader’s tent the next morning,
Hendry heard some remarkable philosophy
from the Indian. “The chief
told me his tribe never wanted food as
they followed the buffalo, but he was
informed the natives who frequented
the settlements often starved on their
journey, ”which was exceedingly true,“
added Hendry. Reciprocal presents
closed the interview. The present to
the Assiniboine Chief was a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
girl slaves, one of whom was murdered
at York ten years afterwards by an
Indian in a fit of jealousy.</p>

<p>Later, Hendry learned that the Assiniboines
did not want these Blackfeet
of the far west to come down to the
Bay. Neither would the Assiniboines
hunt except for food. Putting the two
facts together, Hendry rightly judged
that the Assiniboines acted as middlemen
between the traders and the
Blackfeet.</p>

<p>By the end of October, Hendry had
left the plains and was in a rolling,
wooded land northwest of the North
Saskatchewan. Here, with occasional
moves as the hunting shifted, the
Indians wintered: his journal says,
“eight hundred and ten miles west of
York,” moving back and forward
north and south of the river. Eight
hundred and ten miles would bring
Hendry in the region between the
modern Edmonton and Battleford. It
is to Hendry’s credit that he remained
on good terms with the Assiniboines.
If he had been a weakling, he would
easily have become the butt of the
children who infested the tents like
imps, but he hunted with the hunters,
trapped with the trappers, and could
outmarch the best of them.</p>

<p>When he met Indians hunting for
the French forts, with true trader
instinct he bribed them with gifts to
bring their furs down to Hudson Bay.
Almost the entire winter camp moved
from bend to bend or branch to branch
of the North Saskatchewan, heading
gradually eastward. Towards spring,
different tribes joined the Assiniboines
to go down to York. Among these
were “green scalps” and many women
captives from those Blackfeet Indians
Hendry had met. Each night the
scalps hung like flags from the tent
poles. The captives were given around
camp as presents. One hears much
twaddle of the red man’s noble state
before he was contaminated by the
white man. Hendry saw these tribes
of the Far West before they had met
any white men but himself, and the
disposal of those captives is a criterion
of the red man’s noble state. Whenever
one was not wanted–the present of a
girl, for instance, resented by a warrior’s
jealous wife, she was summarily hacked
to pieces and not a passing thought
given to the matter. The killing of a
dog or a beaver caused more comment.
On the value of life as a thing of
worth in itself, the Indian had absolutely
no conception, not so much
conception as a domestic dog trained
not to destroy life.</p>

<h3>Montizambert Post News</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>H. H. BUSCH, Post Manager at
Montizambert, widely known in
Lake Superior District, recently detailed
himself as a “fatigue party” to
undertake a task usually considered too
weighty for one man to handle. The
job was to remove the engine from Mrs.
Busch’s motor boat.</p>

<p>Once started, however, his pride
would not let him quit. He sailed
into the craft with a hammer, two
wrenches, a file and a pair of chisels.
Chips began to fly; nuts and bolts and
ejaculations filled the air.</p>

<p>Some hours later the clerk saw our
doughty factor wrestling at the water’s
brim, trying to carry the big engine to
the fur house. One spectator remarks,
“A fog was rising from him like that
from a hot spring in winter.” After
a long tussle he and the engine arrived
at the fur house.</p>

<p>At lunch, however, our factor was a
changed man; his appetite was way
below normal. And all afternoon the
“sap” appeared to have all gone out of
him. For once, Mr. Busch had tackled
a job too big for him, but he saw it
through.–A.D.H.</p>

<h2>A Remarkable Trip by U.S.A.
Airmen in a Free Balloon</h2>

<p class='center'><i>From New York to Moose Factory, James Bay,
Ontario, 820 Miles in 25 Hours</i><br />
<br />
By J. BEVERIDGE, Moose Factory</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THREE U. S. A. Airmen left Rockaway
Station, Long Island, New York, on Monday,
13th December, in a free balloon, with the
intention of flying across the State of New
York.</p>

<p>After ascending, and while crossing New
York City, a storm caught them, and drove them
off their course. Being at an altitude of 6000
feet, and above the clouds, they were unable to
see the ground.</p>

<p>The country over which they were flying was
high, necessitating the discharge of ballast to
prevent the balloon striking high land.</p>

<p>Having no chart, and, therefore, losing their
bearings, they were unable to tell over which
part of the country they were flying.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, December 14th, after being in
the air about 24 hours, the men thought they
heard a dog bark, and through a rift in the
clouds they saw a house; they then decided to
descend.</p>

<p>The pilot opened the valve, and the balloon
commenced to descend at a rapid speed. The
wind had carried the balloon beyond the place
where they had seen the house, and there was
nothing but trees on which to land. All the
remaining ballast was thrown overboard to
prevent the basket crashing on the trees; thermos
flasks and all the furnishings were cast over.
But their descent had been too rapid to be
arrested so easily, and the basket collided with
the trees. Too much gas had been released to
allow the balloon to ascend again. The basket
continued to drag through the bush till at last
the balloon came to a halt tangled on the side
of a tree.</p>

<p>The time of landing was about 2 p.m. Taking
a southerly course by their compass, which they
had managed to retain, they commenced to walk
through the bush, but made little headway
owing to the dense mass of foliage, spruce trees,
willows and marshy land. They built a fire,
cooked one of three carrier pigeons. This was
the only food they had had since leaving New
York.</p>

<p>Making themselves as comfortable as possible,
they rested for the night but had little sleep.
Keeping the fire going all night was the only
means of being warm.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 15th, they commenced
their slow progress once more through the bush.
The serious nature of their situation was only
dawning on them at this time, and finding no
house, nor any traces of dogs, they began
thinking their minds had been playing them
tricks.</p>

<p>No food whatever was available, so they had
to make their two remaining pigeons last indefinitely,
not knowing when they would reach
civilization.</p>

<p>As their strength was waning, the oldest man
of the party had discarded nearly all his clothes
keeping only his flying suit and underclothes.
He was nearly “all in” and kept falling down,
but the older of the other two kept them all
going, knowing that to keep going was their
only means of salvation. To stop would have
meant being frozen. Moss was their only food
this day. Again they made a fire and rested for
the night.</p>

<p>On December 16th, Thursday, they set off
again, travelling in a southerly direction. A
second pigeon was devoured. At last they
struck a creek and they were thankful to escape
from the bush, walking on the ice being much
easier. They travelled all day but discerned
no signs of human life. The usual nightly
performance was gone through, and each thought
it all was rather hopeless, but “life is sweet.”</p>

<p>Friday, December 17th, they commenced
their slow and wearisome journey once more,
walking on the creek; but at last the creek joined
the river and here they perceived sleigh tracks.
Noting the direction it had travelled by the
imprint of the dog’s feet, they followed the
trail. About noon they sighted the sleigh, and
the younger of the three commenced to hurry in
an endeavour to overtake the sleigh. At last
the man, an Indian trapper, observed that
someone was endeavouring to overtake him, but,
instead of waiting as would be expected, the
Indian commenced to hurry. It appears that
he was very frightened at the airman’s uniform
or his sudden appearance. The young officer
managed at last to overtake the Indian, due to
the slow progress of the dogs.</p>

<p>The Indian was at last made to understand
that the men were starving and lost, so he took
the young airman to his house which happened
to be at hand, and was, in fact, on Moose Island.
A team was sent for the other two airmen, and
all were brought to the Company’s Post, where
they were thawed out, given a good meal, and
put off to bed.</p>

<p>The airmen’s footwear consisted of ordinary
leather boots, but thanks to the mild spell and
little snow there were no bad effects. “All’s
well that ends well.” Now they are looking
forward to the two hundred miles of snowshoeing
to the main line and let their wives and families
know they are safe and sound.</p>

<p>The names of the airmen are:</p>

<p>Lieutenant Farrell, senior; Lieutenant Hinton,
the one who was responsible for keeping up the
courage of the party, and who was pilot on the
N.C. 4 when Commander Read made the
famous Trans-Atlantic flight; Lieutenant Kloor,
the only free balloon pilot in the party, and who
overtook the Indian.</p>

<p>The trip was, I believe, a record flight for a
free balloon, 820 miles, as the crow flies, in 25
hours.</p>

<h3>Never a “Wild West” in
Canada</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>CANADA never knew a “Wild
West.” We are forced to turn
elsewhere for “penny thriller” and
“dime novel” material, based on
frontier lawlessness and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Three agencies have been mainly
responsible for the peaceful and prosperous
peopling of the West. Two of
them, the R.N.W.M.P. and the Hudson’s
Bay Company, have long ago
received recognition for their part in
this marvel of empire-building. But
there is another whose achievement is
but little known or lightly heralded.</p>

<p>It is WOMAN. Wives and daughters
of the bearded pioneers who
conquered Canada’s plains trekked
west <i>with</i> them; lived in lowly sod-houses;
shared all hardships; made
instant Home wherever the oxen were
unyoked. These women helped tame
a wilderness, and wherever they went
was law and order.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Western America, the
hotbloods, the blacksheep and fortune
hunters sloughed off from a rising
civilization went into the West without
the good influence of womenfolks–and
straight-way became “bad men,”
“killers” and “road-agents.”</p>

<p>Because nearly every early Canadian
in the West had found <i>good women</i>
nearby, there was no “Wild West.”
And the influence of Canadian women
is still alive–on the farms, in the
factories, the stores and in the modern
civic life of this oldtime buffalo kingdom
of the Northwest.</p>


<h3>Abroad at Home</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>WHAT has become of the old-fashioned
winter? We would
like to know the feelings of that self-exiled
band who fled the wholesome
prairies of Canada last fall, as they
open up their home papers on some
Californian strand and read of the ice
famine in Iceland; of the hens laying
and the dandelions sprouting in Canada,
in December; of outdoor swimming
at Vancouver; of spring-like mornings
in Manitoba, with birds singing and
school boys laying off overcoats at play.</p>


<h3>Enthusiasm</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>ENTHUSIASM is the spark which
fires the fuel of ability and personality
to do its work. Without
Enthusiasm, these qualities are dormant
and ineffective–mere potentialities of
power.</p>

<p>A man may overcome error; he may
lack judgment and acquire it; he may
make mistakes and remedy them; but
he can do none of these things without
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>To have enthusiasm is a matter of
“morale”; if you believe in yourself and
believe in the things you do, Enthusiasm
is sure to ignite your dormant power
and bring out your capacities to their
utmost accomplishment. Conquer
doubt, Enthusiasm’s greatest foe.</p>

<p>Be enthusiastic in the doing of even
the smallest job!</p>


<h3>Ideals</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>NO INSTITUTION ever amounted
to anything until some man or
group of men back of it established an
Ideal and set out to attain it. The
realization of any Ideal, or the success
of any business which is struggling
toward an Ideal, requires conviction.
<i>Skepticism, cynicism and pessimism
never made a dollar for anyone.</i></p>

<p>H.B.C. has an Ideal and that is to
<i>serve</i>. Too often, indeed, this is said
by business firms in a trite, meaningless,
parrot-fashion way; but not so with
the Hudson’s Bay Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>With the Company, to <i>serve</i> means
to <i>satisfy</i>. Real satisfaction results
only from high quality merchandise and
high standards of business dealing.
The honor of H.B.C. is bound up with
these, because the Company established
them as Ideals <i>centuries ago</i>.</p>


<h3>The Wilderness Is Shrinking</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>“FLY TO FORT NORMAN” is the
bold headline of a startling advertisement
in Western newspapers,
“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in absolute safety and comfort;
flying time about eight hours each
way,” continues this epochal announcement.</p>

<p>Commercial enterprise has brought
the air-boat to its aid in penetrating
the fastnesses of the Northland where,
reports say, oil will soon be gushing.
But yesterday, this thousand-mile journey
from McMurray down toward the
Arctic Ocean was achieved only by
toilsome weeks of tedious travel. What
must the astonishment of leather-hued
rivermen be to view these winged
canoes darting from civilization to
Norman almost “between meals.” How
that great wilderness shrinks and becomes
smaller. The terror and loneliness
of it, the hardships of it begin already
to pass away.</p>

<p>There are men living who labored
over Chillkoot and spent months on the
ghastly Klondike trail, and they must
marvel at the advantages given by
science and invention to the prospectors
of 1921.</p>


<h3>The Key to Progress</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>TO the plumber, the bathroom is
the most beautiful room in the
house. To him, pipes and joints and
taps are more interesting than Chippendales
and Wedgwood.</p>

<p>Is your office, your desk, your work
the most attractive and interesting in
the whole institution–to YOU? Whatever
your situation or task in the great
H.B.C. organization, endeavor to find
such beauty, charm and satisfaction in
the business of your own little “work-shop”
that the seduction of “greener
fields” may not deceive you. The
greatest symptom of individual progress
is a sincere love for <i>the work in hand;</i>
advancement follows naturally upon a
faithful apprenticeship.</p>


<h3>The Speed Game</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>HOCKEY, king of speed games, is
Canada’s <i>national sport</i>. The
pace of it, the skill and thrill of it appeal
to the youth of Canada. No other boys
in the world could ever play hockey
quite as Canadian youngsters do. Hockey
has developed to suit a temperament
which expresses itself most completely
in this game. It is the spirit
of Vimy Ridge and Festubert that
crops out strongest in a fast rush down
the ice with the puck. The vigor,
stamina, fearlessness and self reliant
manliness demanded by the game are
<i>natural</i>, because the Canadian came
first and then hockey developed as
his characteristic sport.</p>


<h3>What Is <i>Your Best?</i></h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>IF one does <i>his best</i> every day, it
is soon noticeable that what was
<i>his best</i> at one time is not now <i>his
best</i> by any means. Practice in hard
work never fails to enlarge the capacity
for hard work. It is a natural law that
to be strong one must not only possess
muscles but must use them constantly.</p>

<p>There is an immense “shake-up” and
“shake-down” going on in commerce
and industry all over the world. Today
the time of trial for individual efficiency
has arrived. The bricklayer who lays
more bricks than the “average” bricklayer
and the man who can raise his
<i>level best</i> a little higher every day
is the man who will weather the storm.</p>


<h3>Covering a Wide Field</h3>

<h3>“SKIPPERING A SCOW” ON THE
ATHABASCA</h3>

<p class='center'>(<i>Continued from last issue</i>)<br />

By N. A. Howland</p>

<p>The only other boat besides mine that
remained above the rapid was the York
boat, drawn back up to the Island on
the cable to re-load and continue the
trip to McMurray if necessary.</p>

<h4><i>We Cut Loose to Shoot the Rapids</i></h4>

<p>Gathering my crew and sundry other
loose boatmen lying around, we embarked
on the scow for the short but
swift journey, there being sixteen souls
aboard. We shoved off, the steersman
standing on the after-deck, alertly
watching the stream. He worked the
boat into the passage by means of the
sweep, which is a massive oar protruding
half of the scow’s length over
and pivoted to the stern with a steel
pin. This acted as a rudder, but twice
as effectively as the ordinary rudder,
because of its length, with the additional
advantage that being movable up, down
and to either side it offers no resistance
to the rocks, therefore cannot break.
We travelled slowly at first, but
gradually gaining impetus, the scow was
soon tossing in the boiling waters,
travelling with the speed of an express
train. It trembled from stem to stern
with the shock of the waves. There was
an exhilarating sensation with an element
of danger in it.</p>

<h4><i>The Steersman Distinguished
Himself</i></h4>

<p>The performance of the steersman
was admirable. It was difficult to
believe that this lithe, active fellow who
with powerful arms handled the heavy
sweep with such ease, bearing down on
the handle to lift the blade clear of the
water, jumping from one gunwale to
the other with a speed and agility truly
astonishing, could be the same slow-moving
figure that idly lounged on his
oar all the previous way.</p>

<h4><i>We Made the Big Eddy Safely</i></h4>

<p>He seemed to guide the boat as by
instinct and with such unerring skill,
twisting and turning her among the
boulders in the roughest of the water
through the narrow channel, that we
had hardly time to realize what was
happening before the restless figure in
the stern resumed his usual listless
attitude and we were riding in the Big
Eddy. At the cry of “Out oars,” we
were quickly rowed ashore by the
remainder of the crew.</p>

<h4><i>Pulling the Scow Back by Cable</i></h4>

<p>After dropping passengers, no time
was lost in endeavoring to pick up the
cable and pull back to the island.
Luck was against us. Repeatedly the
scow was swept away before the log
attached to the end of the rope could
be caught, though we knew it was being
tossed around on the outer rim of the
eddy. After battling the current for an
hour the men put me ashore. There
were still some matters requiring attention
on the island, so I walked back,
ferrying across again above the rapids.
When I reached the landing place the
crew had just managed to secure the
cable and were being pulled up.</p>

<p>After loading the rails and car wheels
there was nothing to hinder our departure.
My work was done.</p>

<p>The next eighty miles to our destination
was a succession of rapids, but
none bad enough at this time to necessitate
unloading. The journey was
continued next morning, the previous
evening having been spent by all hands
in a futile attempt to dislodge the tug
“Crester.” It was apparent that nothing
but a further rise of water would
move her off, so we left a force of men
to help Captain Barber out of his
difficulty and continued on our way.</p>

<h4><i>We Carried Russian Passengers</i></h4>

<p>Cornwall had previously arranged
with me to take some of the Russians as
passengers, his boat being too crowded
for rough water work. Thus it happened
that thirty of these smelly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
gentlemen were transferred to me.
They were not desirable company on
account of their odour. Besides, they
were afraid of the rapids. The weather,
which ever since our leaving Athabasca
Landing had been perfect, now changed.
The bright sky was obscured by clouds.
It rained intermittently all day. The
Russians huddled themselves up under
my tarpaulins. They presented an inexpressibly
comic appearance to me, as
they sat around for the most part completely
covered up, dismal faces now
and then peering out from unexpected
places to survey the scenes. When the
boat hit a few waves, the lumpy canvas
would contort and wriggle all over in
anguish, uncouth muffled sounds arising.
Louison, who rarely smiled, took
particular pains to seek out the worst
water. He grinned broadly whenever
we struck a big wave.</p>

<h4><i>The Arrival at Fort McMurray</i></h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption"><i>H.B.C. Store at Fort McMurray, Alberta</i></div>
</div>

<p>Next day this eventful voyage ended.
We arrived at Fort McMurray before
noon. There was one particularly
handsome fellow among my passengers,
who attracted me by his refined appearance,
but he spoke no English.
The lad with many of his companions
went in to bathe in the Clearwater
River, which joins the Athabasca at
this point. In front of the village it is
very shallow. This man went out too
far. There was a hole into which he
fell and could not swim out. He was
drowned before it was possible for a
boat to reach him. A drag was improvised
out of a two-by-four to which
were attached cords fitted with fish
hooks. After six hours’ labor our
mournful task was successfully accomplished
and he was laid to rest in a
new outfit of store clothes in accordance
with the Mohomedan faith. Thus for
a week was my journeying at an end.</p>

<h3>FORTY YEARS IN SERVICE OF
THE HUDSON’S BAY COMPANY
INLAND</h3>

<p class='center'>(<i>Continued from December issue</i>)<br />
<br />
By N. M. W. J. McKENZIE</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>BUFFALO were plentiful in my
first years and I have seen thousands
of them. Many of the old
freighters have told me that very
often when the buffalo were travelling
south that they were compelled to stop
their brigades of carts and camp for
one or two days until the great herds
passed. Of course the freighters picked
out the choice ones, or as many as they
required, for meat supply on the trip.</p>

<p>I saw where buffalo in the fall had
tried to cross the Saskatchewan River,
and had broken through the ice. The
animals behind had forced the others
on, trampling them to death. Carcasses
of dead buffalo completely
bridged the river, the remainder of the
herd passing over them. Buffalo
always followed the leader like sheep.
There were millions of them in that
part of the country and all disappeared
in a few years. Today there is
a herd of about two hundred and fifty
animals in the MacKenzie River valley.
They have not increased in numbers.
The Siberian wolves get among them
continually and destroy many of the
calves. There is another herd in the
government park at Wainwright, Saskatchewan,
which is thriving and increasing.</p>

<p>After the buffalo had disappeared,
the plains Indians, who numbered
many thousands at that time, were
reduced to starvation. Many of them
died, and the Canadian government of
that day was compelled to gather them
all into reservations throughout the
country, and ration them. Living in
small log houses, with only one room,
was a great change from their roaming,
open-air life on the plains, and they
became afflicted with all kinds of
diseases, consumption being their greatest
destroyer.</p>

<p>The number of horses an Indian
owned was the gauge of his wealth.
Some of them had as many as three
hundred head, of which quite a large
number were in the buffalo-runner class.
A horse in that class was never put to
any other work. He had to be extra
long-winded, swift and tough as steel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
able to keep pace with a stampeding
herd until his rider had shot down ten
or fifteen animals. As a rule, these
horses stood about fourteen and a half
hands high and weighed nearly a
thousand pounds. Their sires were
usually imported thoroughbreds. The
most of that breed of horses have gone
to the “happy hunting grounds” where
the Indian says the buffalo have gone.
The gun used was a single barrel,
muzzle-loading, flint-lock shot gun,
using number twenty-eight ball instead
of shot. Skill in riding was necessary
and quickness at re-loading.</p>

<p>Fort Ellice, where I was assigned to
duty, was built on the south bank of the
valley of the Assiniboine River. It
was a beautiful location with charming
scenery, about three miles from where
the Qu’Appelle River empties into the
Assiniboine. The Assiniboine Valley
was about two miles wide and that
of the Beaver Creek about one
thousand yards. The Fort was built
on the top level between the two, on a
beautiful plain dotted with little poplar
bluffs, with numerous springs of gushing
water up at the top of the level in the
face of the banks. The river in the
centre of the valley winds its tortuous
way to empty itself later on into the
Red River, thence to Lake Winnipeg,
thence to Hudson Bay and the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>

<p>The Fort itself was built in a large
square, the big front gates being about
thirty yards from the edge of the bank
which was very precipitous at this
point, and well wooded with small
trees, ferns and saskatoon bushes.</p>

<p>On one side of the square was a long
row of one-storey log buildings, with
thatched roofs all joined with one
another. Our carpenter shop was at
one end of this row and the blacksmith’s
shop at the other. The doors
or entrances all faced to the Fort.
There was the men’s house, the mechanics’
house, the native servants’ and
dog drivers’ houses, also the married
servants’ houses, each consisting of one
large room.</p>

<p>A door opened into each from the
outside and there was no other means of
entrance to any of the other houses in
that long row of buildings, except by
its own door or down the chimney.
Two tiers of rough bunks round the
walls represented the sleeping accommodations.
A large mud chimney
and open fire-place provided ventilation.
We did all cooking at the open fireside.</p>

<p>On the other side of the square, in
an equally long row, built in the same
style, were warehouses, ration houses,
dry meat and pemmican house, flour,
pork and beef house, and a well-appointed
dairy, with a good cellar and
lots of ice. These buildings were one
and a-half storeys high and were without
chimneys or fire-places.</p>

<p>At one side of the big gate in front
was the trading store and district
office, and on the other side the fur
store and reserve stock warehouse.
Each of these buildings was very long
and substantial, fully one and a-half
storeys high.</p>

<p>The main building in the Fort was
the Factor’s dwelling or the “big
house,” as it was called. This was the
quarters of the officers and clerks. It
stood well back in the square, its front
being in line with the end of the long
rows of buildings on either side, so that
every house in the Fort could be seen
from its windows. The “big house”
was a two and a-half storey building,
with a large kitchen behind, built from
the same plan as the officers’ dwellings
in Fort Garry, and known as a Red
River frame building.</p>

<p>It had a fine balcony and verandah.
The main entrance was in the centre of
the building opening into a large
recreation and council hall.</p>

<p>The Factor’s private office was at
the right, and the parlour or sitting-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to the left. The large mess-room,
dining-room, and private bedrooms
were in the rear. Upstairs was
a large hall and reading-room, and bedrooms
for the clerks. The upper floor
was heated with large Carron stoves,
as well as the hall downstairs, and the
trading shop and district office.</p>

<p>There were four fire-places on the
ground floor and another in the kitchen,
as well as a large cooking range. A
splendid mud oven stood outside for
baking bread and cooking extra large
roasts. There was also a fine well
close at hand with the proverbial oaken
bucket attached to a rope and chain.
The “big house” and kitchen were
thatched, and all the houses were
mudded and white-washed with lime.
They presented a good appearance
from a distance.</p>

<p>A four foot sidewalk ran all around
the square, and another one from the
front gate to the front door of the “big
house.” There was a nice vegetable,
flower and kitchen garden of about an
acre behind the house. The flagstaff
stood at the front gate, and the belfry
stood outside the Factor’s private
office. While a high stockade enclosed
the whole square, so when the big gates
were locked at night there was no
danger of losing any scalps before
morning.</p>

<h2>FEATURING BONNIE<br />
BABIES</h2>

<p class='center'><i>They Are All Deserving of Prizes and
Deciding Winners Was Difficult</i></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>PROMISING people indeed are the
little pink-toed, plump-jowled
babies of H.B.C. fathers who occupy
the centre of our interest this month.
They are a “full-stage” attraction in
this issue of <i>The Beaver</i>. Find them
over the page in bonnie <i>ensemble;</i> all
at that happy stage of life when
affectation has utterly no power over
dress, expression or gesture. None of
them has been specially posed for the
occasion; some were snapped at most
unconventional moments.</p>

<p>There is no sign of race suicide here.
Yet this showing is only a partial one;
we publish only those winning prizes or
deserving special mention; and in the
limited time allowed for photographs,
there was no opportunity to hear from
a great many points in the far northern
districts.</p>

<p>If we could have got them all in this
group, surely this would be a “Baby
Show” to evoke the plaudits of the
greatest “baby experts.” Weaklings
are notably absent amongst H.B.C.
children, and the judges of the group
of H.B.C. infants presented in this
issue are firmly inclined to the opinion
that H.B.C. babes of the types shown
score just a little higher than babes
ordinarily pictured.</p>

<p>The limitation of the prizes to three
in number proved a real hardship for
the judges, as it was considered the lot
of them possessed prize-winning qualities.
Deciding on the winners was
difficult, but awards were finally made
as follows:</p>

<p class='unindent'><i>First Prize</i>–</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Silver mounted comb and brush set awarded
to Miss Bettie Everitt, daughter of Mr. B. A.
Everitt, of the H.B.C. land department,
Winnipeg.</div>

<p class='unindent'><i>Second Prize</i>–</p>

<div class='blockquot'>Sterling silver thumb spoon, awarded to
Kindersley Lidstone, son of Mr. I. T. Lidstone,
buyer of crockery H.B.C. store at
Kamloops, British Columbia. This fine
baby was born on the day of the 250th
Anniversary Celebration at Kamloops and
was named for Governor Sir Robert Kindersley
by special arrangement.</div>

<p class='unindent'><i>Third Prize</i>–</p>

<div class='blockquot'>Sterling and ivory bell rattle, awarded to
Kathleen Flora Gould, daughter of Mr.
Gould, of H.B.C. Edmonton Store.</div>

<h2>H.B.C. Helped Settlers Remain
on Land During “Lean Years”</h2>

<p class='center'><i>Liberal and Constructive Policy of Company in Disposal
of Its Farm Land Estate in Canada Has Obtained
Agriculturists for the West and Kept Them</i></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>PROBABLY no institution or organization
in Canada has done
more towards pioneering and paving
the way for settlement than the Hudson’s
Bay Company. From the very
beginning, when the first white settlers
began to arrive, agricultural lands were
made available for settlement by the
Company in the Red River Valley, and
as the demand increased, prairie lands
were surveyed into regular townships,
and lands accruing to the Company
were made available for sale at reasonable
prices, and every inducement and
encouragement given to agriculturists
to settle thereon.</p>

<p>There were, of course, in those days,
lean years as well as years of abundant
crops, but prices which could be
realized for grains were usually very
low, and facilities for exporting were
quite inadequate.</p>

<p>There were periods of depression and
sometimes hardship, when the early
settlers and purchasers of the Company’s
lands were unable to meet their
interest payments, and in some cases
the farmers could not even meet their
taxes. During these difficult times,
when lands were not by any means of
such great value as they are today,
and land was a doubtful security, the
Hudson’s Bay Company never wavered
in its confidence in the future of the
West, and in order to assist in maintaining
the optimism of the settlers, the
Company did not unduly press for the
liquidation of its purchasers’ obligations,
but gave every encouragement
to the farmers who suffered reverses,
would even advance taxes to tide them
over until crop conditions improved
and they were able to meet their commitments.</p>

<p>These conditions obtained fairly
often, and by reason of unbounded
faith in the future of the prairie
provinces by the Company’s officials,
hundreds of settlers and agriculturists
were retained for Western Canada,
who in other circumstances would have
abandoned their farms and left Canada
for other parts.</p>

<p>Long before Dominion Government
Surveyors were sent west to sub-divide
the prairies into rectangular townships
under the existing system of Dominion
Government Surveys, and previous to
the surrender of Rupert’s Land by the
Company to the Crown, the Company
arranged to have laid off farming plots
fronting on the Red River, running
east and west to a distance back of
two or more miles.</p>

<p>The first regular sale of farming land
by the Company under the Government
system of surveys is designated as sale
No. 1, the land having been sold to
William McKechnie, of Emerson, Man.
The sale was negotiated on the 4th of
August, 1879, covering the whole of
section 8, township 1, range 3, east of
the principal meridian, containing 640
acres, at the price of $6.00 per acre,
the total consideration being $3,840.00,
which in those days was considered
very fair compensation for such land.</p>

<p>In the present day administration of
the Company’s land, the same sound
policy prevails, and by this time the
Company has sold many thousands of
parcels and continues to make sales,
preferring always to deal with and sell
to <i>bona-fide</i> settlers.</p>

<p>No purchaser of Hudson’s Bay Company’s
farming lands who has made an
honest endeavour to cultivate the land
and use it for legitimate farming
purposes has ever had just cause for
complaint in the treatment he has
received at the Company’s hands.
Lean years are bound to come, and
adversity as the result in some cases is
bound to follow, and when it is fairly
established to the Company that the
farmer has done his part within reason,
he has not been unduly pressed for
liquidation of his indebtedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the regular terms of Hudson’s
Bay farm land sales, the contracts
mature in seven years, but it sometimes
happens that, on account of
adversity over which the purchaser has
no control, it has taken him from
twenty to twenty-five years before he
has been able to fully meet his obligations
and obtain title. The Company
has always been very patient and
lenient with this class of purchaser.
This method of dealing with settlers
and farmers is fundamentally sound,
and instead of a dissatisfied purchaser
abandoning his interest and leaving the
West, he ultimately becomes the possessor
of his
farm, is retained
to Canada, and
is a worthy asset
to the community
to which he
belongs. The
Company’s persistent
policy in
dealing with its
estate in Canada
is fully in keeping
with its traditions
in every
branch of its
business, and
according to the
Company’s
Land Commissioner,
“the
policy of the
directors, as
above outlined,
has been and is
still one of the
chief reasons why the Company has
thousands of satisfied land purchasers,
customers and friends with whom it
has had dealings during the past forty-two
years.</p>

<p>“To date the Company has disposed of
over three and a half million acres of
farming lands in the prairie provinces
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta,
and sales continue to be effected
at the rate of approximately 20,000
acres per month. Practically all the
lands are sold for development and
farming purposes.</p>

<p>“The Company will continue its sound,
proven policy always preserving, under
all circumstances, its established name
for fair dealing, with the primary object
always of contributing, in the fullest
measure possible within its powers,
towards the up-building of Western
Canada, and incidentally doing its
quota towards the building, enlargement
and ever increasing integrity of
the British Empire.”</p>

<h2>How Shipping Rates on Goods
Affect Stores’ Salespower</h2>

<p class='center'><i>What Change Should be Made in Proposed New
Freight Classification (No. 17)?</i><br />

By J. BROWN</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<i>Editor’s Note.–A circular letter,
dated, 7th January, from one of the
best organized trade associations of
Canada, indicates that meetings are
to be held soon to consider the application
of the proposed new
freight classification (No. 17).</i></div>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE latterday high cost of transportation
so vitally affects the
salespower of the Company’s department
stores (as well as other wholesale
or retail stores in Western Canada) that
favourable groupings of certain classes
of goods under the proposed new freight
classification (No. 17) are considered
important in view of the Company’s
great problem of distribution.</p>

<p>While the new schedule is under consideration,
H.B.C. traffic men will see
the advantage of working to secure a
spread of <i>two classes</i> between less-than-carload
and full carload ratings
on drygoods. It is reported also that
every effort will be made to convince
carriers that certain lines of drygoods
should be listed separately or in greatly
restricted groups, instead of being
carried, as at present, under extensive
groups. It is apparent that an important
saving for H.B.C. stores would
result from such re-classification in
view of the 35 per cent. difference
between first and third class and first
and second class ratings.</p>

<p>Under the proposed new freight
classification (No. 17), certain drygoods
shipped in carlots will take a <i>second
class</i> rate. The present classification
(No. 16) on such drygoods gives no
advantage in rate for carloads.</p>

<p>Why classification No. 17 (under
consideration) proposes to allow a
difference of only one class between
L.C.L. and carloads of this commodity
is not clear, inasmuch as for other lines
of goods a difference of <i>two classes</i> is
allowed when shipped by the carload.
Drygoods certainly should be entitled
to take <i>third class</i> rate in carloads.</p>

<p>Furthermore, both the present classification
(No. 16) and proposed classification
(No. 17) arbitrarily “lump” a
great number of lines of merchandise in
a special class without giving a special
carload rate on them (see page 77, item
76, No. 16; page 97, item 60, No. 17).</p>

<p>One of the aims of the proposed new
classification (No. 17) is to place a
reasonable restriction on the indiscriminate
mixing of merchandise which
have a basic difference of origin. Accordingly,
to get the greatest advantage
from this classification for the drygoods
business, those whose interests
are affected will naturally insist upon a
reasonable minimum weight for carloads–say
18,000 pounds. This would
probably mean eliminating, of course,
drygoods “not otherwise specified” and
substituting certain lines of drygoods
which would be entitled to mix and be
eligible for <i>third class</i> rate in carloads.</p>

<p>A few headings are here suggested for
such specified lines:</p>

<p class='hang1'>ALL KNITTED GOODS–Wool or cotton,
such as underwear (men’s, women’s and
children’s), hose and half hose (wool and
cotton), sweaters, toques, heavy wool
gloves. These should be allowed to mix
and make up a carload.</p>

<p class='hang1'>CLOTH–and garments made from same.</p>

<p class='hang1'>VELVETEENS, VELOURS, cotton velvets
and cotton comforters, should be allowed
to mix with cotton piece goods.</p>

<p>Blankets and Boots could not mix with
other lines.</p>

<p>Concerted effort on the part of shippers
should result in these reasonable,
logical and necessary changes being
made in the proposed new classification
(No. 17). In the case of the Company,
the adoption of suggested amendments
along above lines would result in marked
savings on freight charges for at least
three of the four larger H.B.C. stores.</p>

<p>It may be said that the Company in
some instances could not make up carloads
of its own merchandise. Granted
that this is possible, there are a large
number of forwarders in every city of
importance and it is not difficult to
have smaller packages included at
carload rates.</p>

<p>As at present possible on Groceries,
for example, we can cite an instance of
freight being saved by taking carload
rate to Winnipeg and thence to Calgary
or Edmonton through a forwarder.
Below is a statement of a shipment
which moved recently:</p>

<p>OLD WAY–1 barrel of Pickles, 140
pounds, Liverpool to Calgary, L.C.L.
rate, at $5.81.........................$8.13</p>

<p>NEW WAY–1 barrel of Pickles,
140 pounds, Liverpool to Winnipeg,
C.L. rate and Winnipeg to Calgary,
C.L. rate, including forwarding charges
at $3.04½.........................$4.68</p>

<p>The saving of freight on this barrel of
pickles alone was $3.45.</p>

<p>Table No. 1 above shows class rate
comparisons and will make clear the
savings possible on drygoods shipments
under proposed new grouping
and loading.</p>

<p>Supposing in some cases it were not
possible to make up a carload of drygoods
for Calgary or Edmonton, shipments
from Liverpool to Winnipeg in
carloads and thence to the Alberta
points by first class or less than carloads
would still show an appreciable
saving as indicated by Table No. 2.</p>

<p>Due to our inability to make up carloads
from Winnipeg to Vancouver–and
the combined carload rate from
Montreal to Winnipeg and L.C.L. rate
from Winnipeg to Vancouver being
larger than the through L.C.L. rate
from Montreal to Vancouver–this saving
in freight cost would not be felt
on Montreal or Liverpool shipments of
drygoods to Vancouver. The reason
for this is indicated in Table No. 3.
The comparatively lower through L.C.L.
rate from Montreal to Vancouver is
made to meet competition with the
slower but cheaper water route via the
Panama Canal.</p>

<h3>Confirmed Winnipeg Bachelor
Meets Waterloo</h3>

<p class='center'><i>The Happy Couple “Shot” Soon
After The Event.</i><br />

By Our Staff Photographer</p>


<div class='blockquot'>

<p class='drop-cap'>THIS is the tale of a white-coated masseur
who used to be perhaps something of a
woman-hater, the tale of an irresistibly beautiful
maiden in distress, and of the gossamer strands
of a brunette coiffure which were too short–oh,
far too short. It’s a story you’ll never forget
as long as you can remember it!</p>

<p>The co-respondent in the case, the debonair
gentleman in question, Mr. William Saalfeld,
administrator of Winnipeg store’s beauty parlor,
though usually triumphantly successful in the
treatment of the feminine’s crowning glory, was
baffled to the point of desperation. (Ha!–the
plot fattens!)</p>

<p>Try as he might, he, the designer of fabulously
rare head-dresses, could not induce this charming
Madam’s hair to stay “coiffed.” Finally in
great disgust, disregarding his reputation for
impeccable deportment, <i>finesse</i> and <i>savoir faire</i>,
Mr. Saalfeld abandoned this bewitching minx
to her fate, her tresses uncombed, un-marcelled
and undone.</p>

<p>Of course, anyone who could not detect a
“rat” in this yarn, somewhere, must have no
more imagination than an oyster has shins.
The fascinating damsel so endearingly referred
to is a wax figure, as you might have seen upon
close scrutiny of the portrait. The display
department in performing some little operation,
such as amputating a finger, adding a new one
and powdering her face, tossed her pretty locks.
Mr. Saalfeld, whose services were requisitioned
(as you have just heard), gave up in desperation.
How they finally re-dressed her hair is a professional
secret which Mr. Macgregor refuses to
divulge. And the darling maintained a serene
silence, only the deep blush upon her cheek betraying
how her sensibilities had been offended.</p></div>

<h3>MEMORY:<br />
<i>Applied to Efficiency</i></h3>

<p class='center'>By R. J. HUGHES</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>WE are told our brain is composed
of thousands of small cells and
that the average person in a lifetime
only develops a small number. Surely
we were given a brain to use and not
let half or more of it lie dormant. So
let us try and see how many cells we
can develop; in other words, train your
memory to help you more and more,
every day.</p>

<p>Think out a better way of doing some
particular duty you have to perform–a
way that will save time or result in
greater satisfaction to the customer or
the Company. Memorize this and
when the opportunity presents itself,
give it a trial. This principle applies to
any department you may be in, selling,
delivering, packing or unpacking; it
all amounts to the same in the end,
we are all serving the customer in one
way or another.</p>

<p>A salesman I know greatly improved
his position in the Company’s service,
by memorizing the names of all the
customers he served. His method was
to note the personal appearance of the
customer and any peculiarities such as
carriage, gesture or attire, at the same
time pronouncing the name clearly
and making a mental effort to fix it
in memory. After the departure of the
customer, he occasionally repeated the
name to himself. He associated the
customer and the name with as many
ideas as possible; for example, the
particular part of the store where the
customer was purchasing or the customer’s
attitude at the counter. The
impression thus made was reinforced by
subsequent repetition of the name.</p>

<p>Similar plans may be used to memorize
many other things. The particular
“salesman” referred to is now a buyer
and he attributes his success in a large
measure to the foregoing. Of course,
we can’t all be buyers, but we can all
be a little more efficient and in that way
pave our way to greater success.</p>

<h3>Futuristic Fables</h3>

<p class='center'>
<i>Winnipeg Store News as it Will,<br />
Perhaps (?) Be Reported in the<br />
Halcyon Days of, Say, 1945 A.D.</i><br />
</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>MR. GEORGE ASHBROOK, our
resident buyer in Buenos Ayres,
South America, wirelesses his congratulations
to <i>The Beaver</i> upon its attainment
to its twenty-fifth year of publication.
He adds that the annual revolution
in Peru will occur two weeks later
this spring on account of the prolongation
of the rainy season.</p>

<p class='unindent'>THE MARRIAGE is announced of
Frank R. Rogers, the prominent young
Winnipeg banker, son of our print-shop
and book bindery superintendent, to
the belle of the season, Miss Helen
Ogston, on Tuesday next. Social
circles are all agog over the event.</p>

<p class='unindent'>SHORT WEEK-END air flights from
surrounding suburbs to see Winnipeg
with its 1,000,000 population and its
Hudson’s Bay Store, are becoming
quite the thing. Among those who
alighted gracefully upon the store’s
roof-garden ’drome last week-end and
dropped in to see us all, we noticed
Mr. W. J. McLaughlin, of Vancouver;
Mr. J. Prest, of Edmonton; Mr. F. R.
Reeve, of Calgary, and Mr. Hudson,
from Hudson Bay, the genial senior
partner of the firm. Mr. Reeve stated
that his engine had been “missing”
ever since he passed over Regina. A
search party had been organized to
locate it. “Mac” declares it is still
raining in Vancouver, but (like the
cold one does not feel) Coast rain does
not wet one!</p>

<p class='unindent'>DURING BONSPIEL week a very
great curiosity visited the store. An
old gentleman with a typical Scotch
tam upon his head roamed through
the aisles with the fires of recollection
burning in his eyes. The snow of many
Winters was upon his brow and as he
moved gingerly about leaning heavily
upon his cane he was evidently an
interested spectator of the great progress
evidenced on every hand. His
manner and garb plainly bespoke that
prosperity and independence which
possession of plenty of this world’s
goods always develops. He claimed to
be Mr. George Bowdler, erstwhile champion
curler and a member of the
store’s staff twenty years ago.</p>


<h3>The Store Jokesmith</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>MR. CONDUCTOR, please stop the
Orchestra just a moment, while
we breathlessly inquire whether Mr.
<i>Tom Bone</i>, reported in January <i>Beaver</i>
as <i>vers librist</i> and musical instrument
maker of Vernon, should not spell his
name <i>Trom Bone?</i> Sounds like sax-oph-one
and half-a-dozen of the other
to us. (Quick, Friday, the mallet!)</p>

<p class='unindent'>RUMORED, MR. AULIS, in the grocery,
has lately purchased a new house.
We hope he made a good deal and can
sell it, if he wants to, for a $1000 or so
profit, without being called a profiteer!</p>

<p class='unindent'>THERE IS A GENTLEMAN down
here on the prairies who admits he has
bowled 228. Mr. Samuel Beggs offers
to tell who it is, if anyone is in doubt.</p>

<p class='unindent'>IF WISHES were material things we bet:
<i>Mr. Kaufman would have a waist
like Annette Kellerman.</i></p>

<p class='unindent'>SH-SH-SH! Strictly <i>entre nous!</i>
Mr. Wood or anybody’ll tell you that
standing up for the principles one
believes in is like learning to roller skate.
You won’t get anywhere if you sit down
too often.</p>


<h3>Do You Know</h3>



<p class='hang1'>–that Hudson’s Bay Company’s city
delivery rigs made 218,049 deliveries,
travelled 131,162 miles, and disposed
of 267,625 packages during the year
1920? The figures are given by Mr. G.
Russel, the shipping room manager.</p>

<p class='hang1'>–that the Hudson’s Bay Company’s
shipping department despatched to
out-of-town points by express, freight
and mail, 59,519 packages during the
year 1920?</p>

<p class='hang1'>–that the dining room manageress,
Miss Beggs, states that her staff
served 28,238 meals during the month
of December, 1920.</p>

<h3>Write Like the Dickens Is
Right</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>AN Oriental paper having an English
section printed the following notice:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>“<i>The news of English we tell the latest.
Writ in perfectly style and most earliest.
Do a murder commit, we hear of and tell it.
Do a mighty chief die, we publish it and in
borders somber. Staff has each been colleged
and write like the Kipling and the Dickens.
We circle every town and extortionate not
for advertisements.</i>”</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p class='unindent'>MISS CONSTANCE GREENFIELD was
married on February 5th, at St. Luke’s Church,
to Mr. Norman Horton. Mrs. Horton (nee
“Connie” Greenfield) has been with us for eight
years and her place will really seem vacant for a
long time to come. We hope the newlyweds will
enjoy a regular story-book romance. They will
reside at Guelph Apartments.</p>



<div class='bbox'>
<h2><i>WHOLESALE-DEPOT</i></h2>
</div>


<p class='drop-cap'>SEVERAL enjoyable skating and
toboggan parties have been organized
by the members of the staff who
have taken full advantage of the mild
Winter experienced at Winnipeg.</p>


<h3>The Dears Have Taken Up
Curling</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>TUESDAY night, January 18th
saw the commencement of what
we hope to see as a regular feature,
ladies’ night at the Heather Rink.
Four rinks turned out under the
direction of such experienced skips
as D. Swan, Alex. Thompson, McMicken
and Bill Phelan. The girls had
some good sport, but all couldn’t win.
D. Swan and Bill Phelan took the
honors.</p>

<p><i>Heard next morning:</i></p>

<p>1st Girl–“Oh my arms do ache!”</p>

<p>2nd Girl–“Only your arms?”</p>

<p>3rd Girl–“They tell me the stones
weigh 40 lbs. each.”</p>

<p>4th Girl–“400 lbs., you mean, judging
by my back and arms.”</p>

<p>Chorus–“Oh, for ma wee white bed.”</p>

<h3>Why Not a Hudson’s Bay
Bonspiel Week?</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>IS it possible for the stores or other
departments in the Company’s service
to hold a Bonspiel, say in the last week
of February, choosing some central
point, Calgary, for instance. Curling
has many fans amongst Hudson’s Bay
men and some crack rinks could be
assembled.</p>

<p>Could it not be arranged under the
auspices of the H.B.A.A.A. and become
a yearly event? As the rinks consist of
four men only, could they not be
spared during the Bonspiel period?</p>

<p>It would undoubtedly arouse much
interest and enthusiasm in the Company
and is good publicity too. <i>Sweep
hard, you curlers, and let’s have
some suggestions.</i></p>

<p>As a starter, Calgary issues a challenge
to any rink in the Service.–<i>Calgary
H.B.A.A.A.</i></p>


<h3>A Noteworthy Event</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>BABY STODDART was the first
arrival in Calgary in 1921. Roy
Stoddart of the carpet department is
the proud father of the fine son, who
arrived at 7 a.m. New Year’s morning,
and is the recipient of many useful gifts
presented by the Calgary <i>Herald</i> and
city merchants.</p>


<h3>Random Shots</h3>

<p class='unindent'>MISS PATTON, our hosiery buyer,
says: “Window space, like hosiery,
gets most attention when properly
filled.”</p>

<p class='unindent'>MR. HERRING, in men’s furnishing
department, says: “No wonder we
can’t buy a cigar for five cents–look
where the price of vegetables is.”</p>

<p class='unindent'>MR. McKERNAN says: “Speaking
of women having more sense than men–did
you ever notice that when the
baby gets big enough to walk, father
wants to give away the baby carriage,
but mother puts it up in the garret?”</p>

<p class='unindent'>GEORGE GAULD expects to compete
in the skating carnival, 1922. The
new figures that George cuts while on
the ice are somewhat sensational!</p>

<p class='unindent'>“STOP THE PRESS” FLASH.–Bud
Fisher will wear that beautiful new tie
on Easter Sunday. Bud always goes to
Church “Easter Sunday.”</p>

<p class='unindent'>MRS. F. WALLIS, of the audit office,
left the Store last month after four
years’ service. On behalf of the staff
with which she has been associated,
Miss I. Dunlop presented her with a
beautiful cut glass salad bowl.</p>

<p class='unindent'>MRS. M. MOODIE, of the office staff,
is on a three months’ visit to Ireland.
From letters received, she seems to be
having a wonderful time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p class='unindent'>MRS. McCRACKEN (nee Miss Watson),
buyer of the ladies’ furs, is leaving
after nearly seven years’ service.</p>

<p>She had a recent offer of a better
position, and accepted it–<i>she is going
to devote her energies to looking
after her husband and her home</i>.</p>

<p>The best wishes of the whole staff
go with her. Mrs. McCracken is to be
succeeded by Mrs. Thorburn from the
Winnipeg store, who is assured of a
hearty welcome to Calgary.</p>


<h3>January Dance Lively
Affair</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>WITH plenty of “JAZZ” music
and real girls who knew all
about dancing and its inventor, the
Calgary store staff held their monthly
dance on January 19th, at Hickman
Hall. With all the store boosters
helping it along, it could not help but be
a success and those who were present
will tell you it was the best dance of the
season. Our Calgary Editor, Frank
Reeve, was the only one of the store
managers present. He promises to
bring more of the buyers and other
store managers with him if he has to
burn up his own gasoline to get them
there. Our ever-smiling dining room
manageress was in no small manner
responsible for the success of the
dance.</p>


<h3>Calgary Boys Are Enthusiastic
Curlers</h3>

<p class='center'>By LOU DOLE</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THE Calgary stores’ curling club, like
everything under the direction of
the athletic body of the big store, is an
unbounded success. No game that
one could mention is without its followers
in our store and not only are they
followers of the rock and broom game,
the boys who have taken it up are good
at it, at least they will say so and are
willing to back up their assertions at
any time.</p>

<p>Jack Smith is moving around the
store with a lot of extra pep. He is
skipping the only undefeated rink at
present. Jack took the first game from
our G.M. and the second round was
also a win for him after a hard battle
with Bill Cunningham. The following
skips have broken even so far: J. M.
Gibson, Bill Cunningham, Joe Marsh
and Hutchinson.</p>


<h3>A BOTTLE,</h3>

<p class='center'><i>Two Calgary Girls–A Policeman–and
the Boarding House Missus</i><br />

By G. Brennand</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>SOME mixup–not the bottle and
the girls, but the girls and the
boardin’ house missus.</p>

<p>Miss “Joe” Hickey, who hails from
Owen Sound, and Miss Irma Oliver,
from the Gateway City, Winnipeg,
came together in Mrs. Boyd’s invoice
office. They decided to room together
forever. If there is such a thing as two
girls marrying–they married–and so
one Wednesday afternoon they set out
to seek lodging quarters. The first
place they called, the woman looked
them over and said, “Awa’ wi’ you!
I’ll have no young and beautiful girls
amucking up my parlor with their boy
friends.” At the next place they were
in luck. So the story goes, the boarding
missus referred to above, welcomed
them, welcomed them with the odor of
Scotch and cloves.</p>

<p>They were to have the “two-room”
suite in the attic, including use of the
front “piazza.” Joe thought it was a
cook stove and Irma giggled in delight;
she thought it was a Christmas cake.
So they moved in. As all “movings in”
are dressed up by the imagination they
were going to have such fun in this
“dear” of a place–they talked of
parties with coca-cola and everything!</p>

<p>Then they retired–poor Joe woke
Irma up and said, “Did she (the woman
of the Scotch and cloves) say this was
a <i>feather</i> mattress?” Sleepily Irma
said, “Yes.” Joe pushed Irma out on
the floor. “You sleep there then, it’s
my turn to sleep on the feathers.” In
the morning, they broke the ice in the
pitcher to get water. Irma said, “Not
for me; ice baths may be well for Mrs.
Blair, who has time to take ’em, but
not for me, I’ve got that old card to
punch!” With a dab here and a dab
there of a little powder, they were away
to work.</p>

<p>Coming home at night, bubbling over
with anticipation and parcels oozing
out of every pocket, they arrived in the
“suite” with the piazza n’everything.</p>

<p>There on the mantel rested an empty
Scotch bottle! Someone had removed
the chair and the curtains. Evidently
the bottle was left as payment. Poor
Irma, through her tears, said, “Joe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
this is no place for respectable folks,
let’s move again.” The boarding house
missus, who had been listening with her
ear to the keyhole, tumbled in the door,
for the lock was broken too, “I’ll hold
your trunks,” and poor Irma blubbed,
“When you button your coat your
trunk is locked. So is mine. We’ll
see if you will.” And away they went
to the policeman on the corner. He
said, “Go to the sergeant; I’ve troubles
of my own.”</p>

<p>The sergeant said, “Pay your rent;
then move.” And so they did! In
the next episode of this serial, the young
ladies, our heroines, are nestled peacefully

<h3>H.B.C. Edmonton Hockey
Team Sensation of Season</h3>

<p class='center'><i>But They Have Yet to Reckon With
H.B.C. Vancouver!</i></p>

<p class='drop-cap'>HAVING entered a team in the
Senior City Hockey League, it
was apparent that some good opponents
would be encountered, so the H.B.C.
team settled down to hard practice.
Having beaten two Mercantile League
teams in exhibition games by scores
which savored more of cricket than of
hockey, they opened their league engagements
against the University of
Alberta, and a few days later played
the Alberta Government Telephones.</p>

<p>Many good judges of the game were
of the opinion that either of these two
teams would be champions of the
league, but the H.B.C. boys played the
’Varsity to a draw of 6-6, and beat the
’Phones 5-3.</p>

<p>The ’Varsity Game was a stunner,
thirty minutes extra time failing to
break the deadlock.</p>

<p>The ’Phones had already won their
opening league game and were confident
of winning, but they were disappointed,
our boys beating them on
merit.</p>

<p>Following up these two games, we
met and defeated the south side team,
13-5, on January 19th, and now head
the league.</p>

<p>All the players are members of the
H.B.C. staff and incidentally of the
Amusement and Athletic Association,
under whose auspices the team is
entered.</p>

<p>We hear Vancouver store has a
hockey team, and we certainly long
for a wallop at them on their own ice.</p>


<h3>Monthly Dances Becoming
Popular</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>ON Tuesday, January 20th, the
association gave another very
enjoyable dance in the Memorial Hall.
About two hundred couples participated.
Everyone was highly delighted with the
fine floor and the splendid music
rendered by Boyle’s orchestra. Judging
by the ever-increasing numbers who
are attending these monthly dances,
they are becoming very popular.</p>

<p class='unindent'>MISS MOORE, pianist in the music
department, is causing no little comment
among the customers who crowd
around this department to hear her
splendid accompaniment in conjunction
with the pathephones. The effect is
exactly like an orchestra.</p>

<p class='unindent'>MR. ROBERTS, who resigned from
the Company’s service in 1915, to
enter the employ of W. E. Campbell
Co., of Lacombe, has returned to
Edmonton to manage the dress goods
section, recently vacated by Mr.
Florence.</p>

<p class='unindent'>MR. LOCKIE, who has been in the
dress goods department since his return
from overseas, has been promoted to
buyer for the staple section. We extend
to him our most hearty congratulations.</p>

<p class='unindent'>MISS MACDONALD, the assistant
manager of the millinery department,
and MISS PETERSON, the millinery
trimmer, have just returned from a
business trip to Calgary.</p>

<p class='unindent'>MR. HARKNESS, until recently assistant
manager in the staple department,
has been transferred to the men’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
furnishing department as assistant to
Mr. Chassey.</p>

<p class='unindent'>THE GROCERY DEPARTMENT has
been closed out completely in order to
make room for the new Furniture
Department. The GROCETERIA is
to be continued more aggressively than
ever.</p>


<h3>Salesman Should Be Active
Socially, but Not to Excess</h3>

<p class='center'>By W. G. CUNNINGHAM, <i>Asst. Supt.</i></p>

<p class='drop-cap'>BESIDES his duties to the Company
and to himself, the salesman
has a definite place, and definite duty
towards his community. Social relations
are helpful in gaining selling
success, and a good salesman always
has many friends, but like all other
classes of people, he must choose
his friends with care, for we are all
judged by the friends we make and
keep.</p>

<p>The salesman should always be of
the social type, the kind that is fond
of good company, but he must never
let the social duties encroach on his
business sufficiently to impair his efficiency.
Social ambitions are dangerous
to successful selling. An evening
out occasionally at a social function
with several nights intervening for
quiet rest is a good rule. When a
salesman loses the sleep he needs he
will soon develop into the order-taker
type. It takes live, wide-awake human
effort and energy to make sales.</p>


<h3>We Must Have Confidence</h3>

<p class='center'>By G. SALTER</p>

<p><i>Unless</i> the general manager has
confidence in the merchandise manager
and his buyers–</p>

<p><i>Unless</i> the buyers have confidence in
the sales force–</p>

<p><i>Unless</i> the sales force have confidence
in the merchandise they are selling–</p>

<p>We cannot hope to have the confidence
of our customers.</p>

<p>The whole H.B.C. merchandising
system is built on <i>confidence</i>. The
merchandise we buy and sell must be
of that same quality as the Old Hudson’s
Bay Company have sold and
traded for the past two hundred and
fifty years. Confidence in the Old
Company for quality of merchandise
and for fair dealing with those we sell
to and those we buy from must be
maintained at all cost.</p>

<h3>Rest Room Antics</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>AFTER all, associating with the
store family day after day is not
so unlike going to school, is it girls?
There is no pleasanter sight than to
watch the younger set enjoying the
tripping of the light fantastic toe at
the luncheon hour in the employees’
rest room. Another pleasant feature
of this hour of recreation is to see
with what good humour and patience
the senior employees gather around the
walls in order to allow the young folk
scope for using their superfluous energy.</p>

<p>Always, too, one or another can be
found to play the waltz or two-step for
the merry-makers. This is as it should
be, and the spirit of “give and take”
thus inculcated will be of inestimable
service in the building of character.</p>

<h3>Strong H.B.C. Hockey Aggregation
at Vancouver</h3>

<p class='center'><i>But Could Vancouver Get Away
With this Stuff Against Edmonton
H.B.C.?</i></p>

<p class='drop-cap'>ICE hockey has taken a hold
on the staff to such an extent this
Winter that we are able to produce one
of the foremost teams in the commercial
league. The team is on an even basis
with the speedy Kerrisdale team for
first place. These two teams have not
met as yet, but when they do it is safe
to say it will be one of the hardest
contested games of the season.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that our
hockey team has not lost a game as yet.</p>

<p>Our genial general manager witnessed
the H.B.C. team double the score on
the C.P.R. septette and personally
congratulated each of the players on
their fine showing. We hope to see him
at all the games.</p>

<p>Our all-round sport champion, “Jimmie”
McDonald, can make them all
travel. When it comes to goal getting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
“Jimmie” ranks as one of the best in
the league.</p>

<p>Our stonewall defence, Timmins,
Anderson and Ham, are just about the
pick of the league. Percy Timmins, our
coming star defence player, is a decided
attraction to the games, especially to
the fair sex, eh what? “Doc” Almas
can still step out and show the younger
ones how to get goals, as well as stop
’em all when they come.</p>

<p>We would be glad to hear of any
Eastern H.B.C. teams that are prepared
to make a tour. We can’t
guarantee gate receipts or expense
accounts, but we can assure them a
“whale” of a good time if they come
to Vancouver.</p>

<p>In our three games this season, only
six goals have been scored against us.
This speaks well for our goal-tender,
W. Barber.–<i>L. A. Keele.</i></p>

with their presence and a thoroughly

three hundred fifty guests.</p>

<p>Dancing commenced at 9 p.m. and
continued until 1 a.m. W. Garden’s
orchestra rendered selections which
were highly appreciated. Dainty refreshments
were served, and the whole
event proved to be a further laurel in
the crown of the able social committee
of the H.B.C. Welfare Association.</p>

<p>Across the street the big Swede made
known his wants. “Squirrel whiskey,”
yelled the astonished proprietor, “we
don’t have such a thing, but,” in a
whisper, “I can fix you up with a little
‘Old Crow.’” The Swede shook his head.</p>

<p>“I no want to fly,” he answered,
“I yoost want to yump around avhile.”</p>


<h3>Vancouver Welcomes H.B.C.
Arctic Navigators</h3>

<p class='center'><i>Captain Henry Hendriksen and Engineer
Rudolph Johnson Return to Vancouver
after Six Years in the North</i><br />

By MRS. JACK HAWKSHAW</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/i-035-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-035.jpg" width="300" height="234" alt="Photo of two men in newsboy caps" /></a>
<div class="caption"><i>Captain Hendriksen (left) and Engineer
Johnson (right)</i></div>
</div>

<p class='drop-cap'>WHETHER it’s because of the
climate or because the hearts
of those in the West are big, we know
not, but the fact is recognized that no
branch of the Company’s service gives
a heartier handshake and welcome to
the Company’s employees than does
Vancouver retail. When Captain Hendriksen
and Engineer Johnson dropped
in recently after spending six years in
the frozen north, they were royally
welcomed here as brothers in the
H.B.C.</p>

<p>Captain Hendriksen and Engineer
Johnson operate the H.B.C. gas schooner
“Fort McPherson,” a boat of fifty tons
which, together with the “Ruby” left
Vancouver in 1914 to carry provisions
to the Company’s Western Arctic posts
together with lumber and materials
for the building of a post at Herschel
and Baillie Islands.</p>

<p>Fair weather and good luck attended
the expedition until it reached Point
Barrow where ice was encountered and
they were compelled to fall back to
Tellar Point, a hundred miles north
of Nome, Alaska, before returning
south, where the cargo of the “Ruby”
was discharged and the “Fort McPherson”
beached for the Winter. In
July, 1915, the “Ruby” returned from
the south, picked up her cargo again,
and with the schooner “Fort McPherson,”
set sail for Herschel Island,
arriving there in August, 1915.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Since August, 1915, the Company
has opened seven fur trade posts in
the Western Arctic, the first being at
Herschel Island; then followed one at
Baillie Island, two hundred fifty miles
east of Herschel and since then others
have been established at Kittigazuit,
Aklavick, Fort Thomson, Three Rivers,
Kent’s Peninsula and Shingle Point.</p>

<p>The “Fort McPherson” is the Company’s
supply boat which during the
Summer distributes the goods sent to
Herschel Island and to the small posts
in the Arctic.</p>

<p>Captain Hendriksen and Engineer
Johnson are on their way to Winnipeg
on vacation. During their leave of
absence, the “Fort McPherson” will
remain at Kittigazuit. It is the Captain’s
intention to continue this trip
to the home of his aged mother who is
about to celebrate her centenary in
Denmark, and whom he has not seen
for thirty years.</p>

<p>The journey to the coast was, as
they term it, an uneventful one,
being the same kind of an experience
they are accustomed to and which is
part of the daily round of all the
Company’s employees in the Arctic.
But to us it reads like a fairy tale.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you will, two men starting
on a twelve hundred mile “mush” from
Herschel Island to Fairbanks in a
sleigh drawn by four large “huskies.”</p>

<p>The frozen country they traversed
is broken only by the remains of a once
great forest, an ice-locked lagoon,
horizons bounded by irridescent glaciers
whose tips pierce the sky–and over all
the sparkling arctic sunshine flooding the
wide plains which stretch away to the
Mystery of the World. In their long
hike they met no human being except
one roving band of Indians. But they
saw immense herds of cariboo, many
moose, and now and then a cinnamon
or grizzly bear. And all the while,
the thermometer ranged from 47 to 70
degrees below zero.</p>

<p>At night they rested under the
canopy of the stars in a small tent
perched impertinently in one of earth’s
most awful and majestic solitudes.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself the long trail, the
occasional pause in the wilderness to
stalk and kill a cariboo or moose for
food to replenish the larder of the
voyageurs and their faithful dogs.</p>

<p>Their journey lasted for forty days.
Arctic blizzards crossed their path.
These stout hearted men, however,
were able to make their way through to
seaboard and embark for civilization
for the first time since before the
great war.</p>


<h3>H.B.C. Salespeople Will Be
on <i>Qui Vive</i> During
Coming Outfit</h3>

<p class='drop-cap'>STORES generally realize that the
coming six months will test the
worth of salespeople more than for
many months past. We haven’t been
selling goods; <i>we’ve been handing
them out</i>. <i>People have been anxious
to buy.</i></p>

<p>A change has taken place. The public
is inclined to look for further price
reductions. H.B.C. people know that
the goods on our shelves have been
bought wisely and well. Every advantage
of our buying organization
was used in their assembling. The
same goods cannot be purchased elsewhere
for less money; that gives the
sales-person confidence in selling.</p>

<p>Let us prove to the Company that
we are <i>salespeople</i>–not order takers;
let’s do this by being willing, courteous
and eager to please.</p>

<h3>THE SITUATION</h3>

<p class='center'><i>In Canadian Trade and Finance</i><br />

(From Reports of the Union Bank)</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THE Canadian official record shows
that the increase of wholesale
prices of all commodities reached in
May, 1920, over the average prices of
the year 1913, was 163 per cent, and
that, as between the figures for May
and December, a decline of almost
fifteen per cent. was recorded. The
decline was especially noticeable in the
prices for grains, fresh vegetables,
breadstuffs, tea, coffee and sugar;
certain items in the textile group–cotton,
silks and jutes, also show declines.</p>

<h4><i>Canada’s Volume of Trade
Increases Half Billion</i></h4>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that an
adverse balance will be shown for
the first time since the outbreak of the
war, the year 1920 was a record one
so far as the total trade of Canada is
concerned. Statistics for the twelve
months ending October, 1920 (the
latest figures available), show that the
total volume of trade amounted to
$2,603,423,987, an increase of $500,000,000
as compared with the previous
twelve months’ period. The unfortunate
feature, however, is the excess of imports
amounting to more than seventy-five
million dollars, which compares
with a favorable balance of about three
hundred and fifty millions for the twelve
months ending October, 1919. Practically
the whole of the half billion
dollar increase in the total volume of
trade is due to the growth of our
imports for our export increase amounted
to approximately only eleven million
dollars. The important feature of the
statistics is the record of our buying
and selling with the United Kingdom
and the United States. Compared with
last year, our imports from the United
Kingdom have increased to the extent
of nearly one hundred fifty millions.</p>

<h4><i>Canadian Banking System
Demonstrates Merit</i></h4>

<p>On account of the fact that practically
all the business of Canada is
transacted through its banks, the Canadian
Banking System enjoys a unique
position compared with the systems
of other countries, and accordingly the
statement of the Chartered Banks of
Canada for the year ending October,
1920, reflects better than any other
medium, the actual business condition
of this country.</p>

<h4><i>Banks Curtailed Credit to
Stabilize Business</i></h4>

<p>Much has been said and written in
criticism of the policy of the banks in
curtailing credit, but there is not the
least doubt that the present comparatively
favorable condition of Canada
is due in good part to the continuous
pressure that has been exercised by the
banks, throughout the year, to restrict
advances.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this effort on the
part of the banks, current loans are
higher by three hundred million dollars
than they were a year ago. If a conservative
policy had not been adopted,
the increase in loans would have been
considerably greater; as it stands, the
increase is balanced by a corresponding
decrease in holdings of Government
securities, acquired originally in connection
with the Dominion and
Imperial Governments’ war financing,
and now redeemed.</p>
